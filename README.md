# Purpose
Deciding whether it will be a diet app where I would input what food I ate and 
then it shows you what the calorie count is 

Whether you input the food you eat and the price on the menu and then you can figure out
if you beat the buffet and by how much.
- This would not require API
- Just add your cost
    - If you don't know the price, input the menu prices and then you can check. 
    - Make your time and stomach worth it

- In the future if I want it to be diet app. Can change the name to "Battle Buffet"
    - Battling the endless food in front of you. also can mean battling the buffet.
